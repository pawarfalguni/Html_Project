      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Backtracking is the form of recursion</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The usual scenario is that you faced with number of option, and you have
        to choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get new set
        of option; just what set of option you get depends on what choice you
        made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach final
        state. If you made sequence of choices, your final state is goal state;
        if you did't, it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Conceptually, You start at the root of the tree; the tree probably has
        some good leaves and some bad leaves, through it may be that the leaves
        are all good or all bad. I want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        begining with the root, you choose one of its children,to move, and you
        keep this upto until you get a leaf.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search
        for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out new
        option in that set of option. If you run out of the options, revoke the
        choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you
        end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leves to be
        found.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This needs an example.</p>

      <h3>The backtracking alogorithm.</h3>
      <pre>
                boolean solve(Node n){
                    if n is a leaf node{
                     if the goal node, return true
                     else return false
                     }else{
                         for each child c of n{
                             if solve(c) succeeds, return ture
                          }
                        return false
                    }
                }
            </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Notice that the algorithm is expressed as the boolean function. This
          is essential to understanding the alogorithm. If slove(n) is true,
          that means node n is the part of solutin--that is node n is the one of
          the nodes on the path from the root to some goal node. We say that n
          is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path, that
          includes n to any goal node.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>How does this work?</h4>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of path
        to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of n is
        solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above
        code, this is done by the lines
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
                for each child of c of n{
                    if slove(c) succeeds, return true   
                }
                return false
            </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf
        node is goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node,
        it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, ths is
        done by the lines.
      </p>
      <pre>
                if n is a leaf node{
                    if the leaf is goal node, return true
                    else return false
                }
            </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The backtracking is simple but important. You should understand
        throughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>To search a tree?</li>
      </ul>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>
          If the tree consist of single leaf, test whether it is goal node.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, search a subtrees until you find one containing a goal
          node,or until you have search them all unsuccessfully.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
      <p>
        Backtracking is a rather typical recursive alogorithm, and my recursive
        algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In that is how your
        recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
                boolean solve(Node n){
                    put node n on the stack;
                    while the stack is not empty{
                        if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
                            if it is a goal node, return true
                            else pop it off the stack
                        }
                        else{
                            if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                            push the untried children onto the stack
                        else pop the node off the stack
                        }
                        return false
                    }
                }
            </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed on the stack
        are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and
        these are only pushed on the child at the time; hence, the nodes on the
        stack all the times, describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are remove
        from the stack only when it is known they have no goals among their
        decendents. Therefore if the roots nodes get removed(making the stack
        empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to
        the problem.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack
        from(in reverse order)a path from the the root to a goal node.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Similarly, when the recursive algorithm find a goal node, the path
        information is embodied(In reverse order) in the sequence of the
        recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be
        recovered one node at a time, by(for instancce) priniting the node at
        the current level, or storing in the array.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Here is recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print(in
        reverse order) the node along the successful path:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
                boolean solve(Node n) {
                    if n is leaf node {
                        if the leaf is a goal node {
                            print n
                            return true
                        }
                        else return false
                    }else{
                        for each child c of n {
                            if solve c succeeds {
                                print n
                                return value
                            }
                        }
                        return false
                    }
                }
            </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
      <p>
        All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple,
        but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up
        with details. Even detemining the node is a leaf can be complex:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess game
        problem, the leaves are the checkmates and stalemate solution.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        To keep the program clean, Therefore the test like these should be
        buried in methods. In a chess game, for example you could test whether a
        node is a leaf by writing a&nbsp;<strong>gameOver method</strong>.(or
        you could even call it&nbsp;<strong>isLeaf)</strong>&nbsp;. This method
        would encapsulates all the ugly details of figuring out whether any
        possible moves remain.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Notice that backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each
        node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already
        (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this
        look simple, by just saying&nbsp;<strong>for each child c of n.</strong
        >&nbsp;In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible
        children are, and there may be no obivious way to step through them. In
        chess, for exampel, a node represent one arrangement of pieces on a
        chess board, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement
        after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children,
        and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node
        have been tried is as follows: Upon intial entry to the node (that is,
        when you first get there from above), make a list of above children. As
        you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there
        are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is
        a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried,
        if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering,
        and you know which child you just tried, you can tried which child to
        try next.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        For example, you might be able to number the&nbsp;<strong
          >children 1 through n,</strong
        >&nbsp;and try them, in numerical order. Then, if you have just
        tried&nbsp;<strong>child k,</strong>&nbsp;you know you have already
        tried children 1 through&nbsp;<strong>K1,</strong>&nbsp;and you have not
        tried
        children&nbsp;<strong>K+1</strong>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<strong>n.</strong>&nbsp;Or,
        if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always
        try&nbsp;<strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong
        >&nbsp;If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you
        are searching for maze, you can choices in the order left, straight,
        right&nbsp;<strong>(Or perhaps north, east, south, west).</strong>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a
        node.&nbsp;<strong>In the chess game example,</strong>&nbsp;you might
        number your pieces (Or perhaps the square of the board) and try them in
        a numerical order, but in addition each piece may also have serval,
        moves and these must also be ordered.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
      <p>
        For starters, Let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking
        which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of
        tree, a binary tree.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is
        designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero,
        one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are
        referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are
        reachable (by one or steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles.
        For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a
        binary tree, we will say that a node might not be a goal node, and will
        contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here)
        show a binary tree.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Here's a definition of the Binary Tree Class:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
            public tree BinaryTree {
                BinaryTree leftChild = null;
                BinaryTree rightChild = null;
                boolean isGoalNode = false;
                string name;

                Binary tree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                    this.name = name;
                    leftChild = left;
                    rightChild = right;
                    this. isGoalNode =isGoalNode;
                }
            }
        </pre
      >
      <p>
        Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and iTree root a,b,c,d,e,f; c=
        d=n it we will define a method make tree() which construct the above
        binary tree.
      </p>
      <pre>
            static BinaryTree maketree() {
                BinaryTree root a,b,c,d,e,f;
                c = new BinaryTree ("c", null, null, false);
                d = new BinaryTree ("D", null, null, false);
                e = new BinaryTree ("E", null, null, true);
                f = new BinaryTree ("F", null, null, false);
                a = new BinaryTree ("A", a , c , false);
                b = new BinaryTree ("B", e , f , false);
                root = new BinaryTree ("Root", a , b , false);
                return root;
            }
        </pre
      >
      <p>Here's a main program to creta a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
      <pre>
            public static void main(string args[]) {
                BinaryTree tree = maketree();
                System.out.println(solvable(tree));
            }
        </pre
      >
      <p>
        And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routin to "solve" the
        binary tree by finding the goal node.
      </p>
      <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
                /* 1 */ if(node == null) return false;

        <li>
          If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so
          that we can call this method with the children of a node, without
          first checking whether those children actually exist.
        </li>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
        <li>
          See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that
          node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null
          and is not a goal node, says to
        </li>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li>
          Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In
        the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
        alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur
        only if they do. Here's that alternative version:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { 
                if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
                if (node.leftChild != null &amp;&amp; solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
                if (node.rightChild != null &amp;&amp; solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
                return false; }
        </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly
        more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>What are the children?</h3>
      <p>
        One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that,
        at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous
        choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as
        far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible
        solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate
        children immediately, without recursion. Consider, for example, the
        problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any
        map on a plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be
        colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a
        border are the same color. To color a map, you choose a color for the
        first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all
        countries are colored.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you
          run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.
        </li>
        <li>
          Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an
          adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of countries, you
          have successfully colored the map.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a
        checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkerboard
        only needs two colors.
      </p>
      <p><strong>boolean mapIsOK()</strong></p>
      <p>
        Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is
        colored correctly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</strong></p>
      <p>
        Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent
        node already colored with the given color.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</strong></p>
      <p>
        Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and
        column of the next square on the checkerboard).
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
      <pre>
            boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
                 if (row &gt;= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK();
                  map[row][column] = color;
                   for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor &lt;= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                     int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                      if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
                     } 
                     return false; 
                    }
        </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
      <pre>
            boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) { 
                if (row &gt;= NUM_ROWS)return true; 
                if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
                     map[row][column] = color; 
                     for (int nextColor = RED;
                      nextColor &lt;= BLUE; nextColor++) { 
                        int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                         if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
                     }
                }
                          return false;
            }
        </pre

        Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good.
        However, the timing information suggests otherwise:

        The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less
        than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods
        could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically
        eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent
        exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is
        reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any
        way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!

      <p><strong>Debugging techniques</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it.
        Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting
        print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use
        of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are
        especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and
        return (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to
        print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value
        it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's
        hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries.
        Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember
        that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or
        (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more
        debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs the proportions
        will be better.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
        static String indent = "";
        static String name(BinaryTree node) {
             if (node == null) return null;
             else return node.name; 
        }
            
        static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
          System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
          indent = indent + "| ";
        }
        
        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
          indent = indent.substring(3);
          System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); 
          return true; 
        }
        
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { 
            enter(node); 
            if (node == null) return no(node); 
            if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node); 
            if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node); 
            if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node); 
            return no(node); 
        }
    </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And we get this results:</p>
      <pre>
        Entering solvable(Root) 
        | Entering solvable(A) 
        | | Entering solvable(C) 
        | | | Entering solvable(null) 
        | | | solvable(null) returns false 
        | | | Entering solvable(null) 
        | | | solvable(null) returns false

        | | Entering solvable(E) 
        | | solvable(E) returns true 
        | solvable(B) returns true solvable(Root) returns true 
        true
    </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much
        work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual
        program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information
        from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your
        manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a
        lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to
        replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every
        return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might
        introduce new bugs into your program.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional.
        For example,
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
        static final boolean debugging = false; 


        static void enter(BinaryTree node) { 
            if (debugging) { 
                System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 
                indent = indent + "| "; 
            } 
        } static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { 
            if (debugging) { 
                indent = indent.substring(3); 
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); 
            } 
            return true; 
        } 
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node) { 
            if (debugging) { 
                indent = indent.substring(3); 
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false"); 
            } 
            return false; 
        }
    </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control
        different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your
        code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable
        debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will
        be discarded.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it
        happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since
        an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your
        own Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you
        can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following
        code
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        will print out a message something like this, and the program will then
        continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print
        statement.

        The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In
        solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this
        case means a position from which no further moves are possible.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This isn't so easy. Now to the program. The main program will initialize
        the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve
        the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a
        winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to print
        out the bad news.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In
        solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this
        case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This
        isn't so easy. Each possible move will result in a new board position,
        and these new board positions are the children of the current board
        position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board
        position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember
        that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible
        moves. Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we
        must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches
        would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you
        were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally
        valid approach.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it
        can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it
        cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible
        moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in
        turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the
        possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where
        each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number
        and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither
        alternative is very attractive.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a
        unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular
        marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a
        move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move
        possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a
        move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every
        space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles)
        stay in one place.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just
        check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either
        zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a
        boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines
        whether a move is possible from the given position:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>
          If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move
          or jump to the right;
        </li>
        <li>
          If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move
          or jump to the left.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        We write another method&nbsp;<strong
          >int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</strong
        >&nbsp;that will take a board and a position, make a move from that
        position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this
        somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than
        creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In
        technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Along with&nbsp;<strong>canMove and makeMove</strong>, we are using
        methods&nbsp;<strong>puzzleSolved and printBoard</strong>&nbsp;with
        meanings that should be obvious. With these methods, our central
        backtracking method can be written as follows:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <pre>
            boolean solvable(int[] board) { 
                if (puzzleSolved(board)) { 
                    return true; 
                } 
                for (int position = 0; position &lt; BOARD_SIZE; position+;
                if (canMove(board, position)) { 
                    int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 
                    if (solvable(newBoard)) { 
                        printBoard(newBoard); 
                        return true; 
                    } 
                } 
            } 
            return false; 
        }
         </pre
      >
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and
        printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</li>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <mark>
        Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on
        the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last line. I've added line
        numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point.
        Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in
        reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results
        again to get them in the correct order.
